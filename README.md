# GifToTextureGUI
A programme for converting gif files to animated minecraft textures
### Features

- automatic conversion from gif to tiled image and written json file for the texture
- interpolation checkbox for the output textures
- adjustable ticks per second box for texture playback speed.
- import and save buttons as well as a "viewport" to display the imported gif 

### notes
- I'm very new to pretty much all of c#, and github, so my code probably isnt optimised in any way but it works and im proud of it.
- I'm not sure how to upload stuff to github like completely so if ive uploaded the source code incorrectly please let me know and ill try to fix it.




### Usage/Examples
to convert a gif to a texture first, open GIfToTextureGUI, click the import button and navigate
to your gif and open it. then select your TPS (Ticks per second, leave at 2 if unsure) and [interpolation] settings. Next press save and name them according to the texture youre replacing (e.g. dirt.png). Finally place those two files in your texturepack and reload textures. If you don't know how to make a texture pack id suggest watching [this quick video](https://youtu.be/sCiXqcsaocM)
